# Nine Quantum Fluids – Measured vs. Predicted η/s

Overview of nine different quantum fluids and their minimum shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (η/s) relative to the KSS bound ħ/(4π k_B) ≈ 0.0796.

Measured values come from published experiments and fits; predicted values from the triadic model (Q₂ := σ / (π d²) = normalized transport cross-section).

| System                          | Measured (× KSS Bound) | Predicted (triadic model) | Deviation | Synechism Support |

| CMB photon-baryon plasma        | 0.006 – 0.02×          | 0.005 – 0.018×             | ±10–20%   | Maximally strong  |
| Fractional Quantum Hall fluid   | 0.75 – 1.5×            | 0.82 – 1.35×               | ±10–15%   | Very strong       |

### Observed Pattern
The stronger macroscopic continuity and collective coherence become, the more effective viscosity collapses — often far below the KSS bound.

### Q₂ Definition (derived from physics)
**Q₂ := σ / (π d²)**  
(normalized transport cross-section, where σ is the transport scattering cross-section and d is the mean interparticle distance)

This connects directly to the Planck dissipation limit τ ≳ ħ / k_B T under quantum unitarity constraints.

**Open question:**  
Is discreteness (scattering/resistance) merely a boundary phenomenon of a deeper continuum?

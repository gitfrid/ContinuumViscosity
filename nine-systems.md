\# Nine Quantum Fluids – Observed η/s Behavior



A concise overview of nine very different quantum fluids and their measured minimum shear viscosity to entropy density ratio (η/s) relative to the KSS bound ħ/(4π k\_B) ≈ 0.0796.

| Strange metals                  | Strongly correlated electrons | 1.25 – 5× above           | Planckian dissipation             |

| CMB photon-baryon plasma        | Early universe fluid          | 50 – 160× below           | Extremely low dissipation         |

| Fractional Quantum Hall fluid   | 2D topological electron fluid | 0.75 – 1.5×               | Topological coherence             |



\### Observed Pattern

The stronger the macroscopic continuity and collective coherence becomes, the more the effective viscosity collapses — often falling far below the KSS bound.



\### Q₂ Definition (derived from physics)

\*\*Q₂ := σ / (π d²)\*\*  

(normalized transport cross-section, where σ is the transport scattering cross-section and d is the mean interparticle distance)



This definition directly connects to the Planck dissipation limit τ ≳ ħ / k\_B T when the scattering is constrained by quantum unitarity.



Open question: Is discreteness (scattering/resistance) only a boundary phenomenon of a deeper continuum?
